# Covid-19-Tracking

The purpose of this Application is to vizualize the Covid-19 outbreak. 

The beginning stages of development will include a base Gmplot (python google Mapping API). A secondary "Heat Map"
will be overlayed onto the basemap to highlight areas of high concentrations of Covid-19 cases to date of
creation. The case numbers will be updated from the cdc website "https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/cases-updates/cases-in-us.html". 

Another link to find data: https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2020/apr/08/coronavirus-map-of-the-us-latest-cases-state-by-state.

For future progressions of this application a "future cast" of the area affected by this outbreak will be highlighted. 

Areas that would constitute as a area that is at risk to a high level of cases. 
        1) Population 
        2) Major Airports 
        3) Economic standing
        4) Population Density
