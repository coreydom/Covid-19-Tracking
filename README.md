# Covid-19-Tracking

The purpose of this Application is to vizualize the Covid-19 outbreak. 

The beginning stages of development will include a base Gmplot (python google Mapping API). A secondary "Heat Map"
will be overlayed onto the basemap to highlight areas of high concentrations of Covid-19 cases to date of
creation. 

For future progressions of this application a "future cast" of the area affected by this outbreak will be highlighted. 

Areas that would constitute as a area that is at risk to a high level of cases. 
        1) Population 
        2) Major Airports 
        3) Economic standing
        4) Population Density
